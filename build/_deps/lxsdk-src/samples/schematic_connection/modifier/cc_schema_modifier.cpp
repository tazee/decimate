/*
 * MODO SDK SAMPLE
 *
 * Schematic Modifier Example
 * ======================
 *
 *	Copyright 0000
 *
 * This example implements an item type with a default
 * schematic connection.  The connected item's channel
 * count is read and a channel on our implemented item
 * is updated with that channel count.
 *
 * CLASSES USED:
 *
 *		
 *		CLxPackage
 *		CLxMeta_Package
 *		CLxChannels
 *		CLxMeta_Channels<>
 *		CLxMeta_SchematicConnection<>
 *		CLxEvalModifier
 *		CLxMeta_EvalModifier<>
 *		
 *
 * TESTING:
 *
 *	Create a new csam.schema.modItem item and add it to the schematic.
 *	The created item should be called "Graph Test Item" in the scene.
 *	Bring the camera or another item into the schematic and connect it
 *	to the Graph Test Item's schematic input.  Select the Graph Test Item
 *	and look in the channels list.  At the bottom, you should see the 
 *	channelCount channel set to some non-zero number.  Disconnect the 
 *	schematic connection and mouse over the channels list again, and the
 *	channelCount should reset to 0.
