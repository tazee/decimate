 * nexus supports two ways to find nodes for network rendering: Bonjour, which finds
 * node automatically, and host lists, which uses a static list of IPs or host names.
 * It is also possible to attempt a one-off connect to another host.  As with all
 * hosts, if the connection is successful it will remain connected until either the
 * machine quits.  Since the connection is async, there is no feedback as to the
 * success or failure if this.
 * There is a single method to make the connection, OneOffHostListAdd(). This looks
 * up the host by hostname, or if that is NULL, by IP.  The port is the used to connect
 * to the remote host.  Normally this LXiNETWORK_NETRENDER_PORT, the default port, 
 * since that's the one tha other instances of modo will be listening on, but there
 * are cases where an alternate port is useful.  For example, when for rendering on
 * virtual machines where multiple isntances of the VM are running on hte same machine,
 * each will expose a different port to the host machine that is mapped to the standard
 * port inside the VM.

 * As with all globals, the first method gets the ILxScriptQueryID interface for

 * 
 * 
 * It is also possible to remove a one-off connection.  This is really just a clean-up
 * phase; it doesn't disconnect from the host.  It's usually useful to remove it when
 * you want to try to reconnect to it as calling OneOffHostListAdd() on an already
 * connected host will have no effet.
